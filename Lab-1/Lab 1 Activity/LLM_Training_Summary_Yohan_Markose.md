## Training LLM Models - Summary

I have created a report on the steps and considerations that need to be considered when training LLM models. The most important aspect when it comes to this is to ensure that resulting model is well-suited for its intended application while making efficient use of available computational resources. It is also important to consider what all resources are available to us.

So a general approach would be to first choose a pre trained model as base, prepare the dataset (depending of the end goal for the trained llm), we then tokenize the data and then fine tune the model by considering techniques such as Instruction Fine Tuning, Few-Shot Learning, Sequential fine tuning.. etc. The last step is to test the fine tuned model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, F1-score etc.
