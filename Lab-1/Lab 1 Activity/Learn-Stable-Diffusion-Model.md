# Stable Diffusion Model

Stable Diffusion is a deep learning model that generates unique photorealistic images from text prompts. 

It is primarily used to generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions, though it can also be applied to other tasks such as inpainting, outpainting, and generating image-to-image translations guided by a text prompt.
