Summary : 
An open-source Python framework called Streamlit makes it easier to create interactive web apps for 
projects involving data science and machine learning. With little effort and code, developers can turn 
data scripts into shareable, user-friendly web applications. The goal of Streamlit is to facilitate 
rapid prototyping and iteration by offering a smooth development experience. Users may develop dynamic
 apps that visualise data, take user input, and communicate with machine learning models in real time 
 with only a few basic Python instructions.

There is no need for further front-end development because the library is made to function directly with Python. 
Developers may easily illustrate to non-technical stakeholders how their models and analyses work by using widgets, 
graphs, and interactive elements. The ease of use and adaptability of Streamlit have made it a popular choice for 
data professionals looking to showcase their work through intuitive, interactive web interfaces.
