# Basics of LangGraph, its workflow traceability and process visualization

## Summary of Learnings:
LangGraph is a library for building multi-operator applications with LLM, that provides a graph-based approach to building agentic workflows. It uses a shared state structure and supports round-robin accounting which creates a complex agent architecture. 
The framework provides powerful workflow tracking capabilities through integration with tools such as LangSmith and Langfuse, allowing for detailed inspection and debugging. 
LangGraph also offers a variety of process visualization options, including LangGraph Studio and its built-in graph visualization methods This helps developers better understand and improve their agent workflows. These features enable the creation of complex, traceable AI agents.
