Apache Airflow is an open-source tool for orchestrating, scheduling, and monitoring workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). 

It allows users to define workflows in Python, making them dynamic and easy to manage. 
With a rich set of operators and hooks, it supports integrations with databases, APIs, and cloud services. 

Airflowâ€™s web-based UI enables real-time monitoring and management of tasks, while its scalable architecture supports distributed execution. 
It is widely used for data pipelines, ETL processes, and machine learning workflows.
